## Description

This project uses multiple linear regression to analyze the relationship between an individual's salary, years of experience, and age. The model is built using Python with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`. 

### Features:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Visualization of the data using scatter plots.
- Implementation of a multiple linear regression model.
- Evaluation of the model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Salary_Data.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `YearsExperience`: The number of years of work experience.
- `Age`: The age of the individual.
- `Salary`: The salary of the individual.

### Sample Data
| YearsExperience | Age  | Salary |
|-----------------|------|--------|
| 1.1             | 21.0 | 39343  |
| 1.3             | 21.5 | 46205  |
| 1.5             | 21.7 | 37731  |
| 2.0             | 22.0 | 43525  |
| 2.2             | 22.2 | 39891  |
